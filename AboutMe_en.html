	<h2>Personal information</h2>


I was born 15 December 1963 in Sevastopol, Ukraine.<br>
I have been composing since 22 years old. It is all started as a simple fascination, but then transformed  to the real calling. My professional activity started in 2000. It's hard to explain style I am working in. Maybe you will cope with this? My view is simple - music have to be simply liked. Does anyone are about the style when they hear music?<br>
From the very beginning my music was English language orientated. English language is quite melodious. Of course it doesn't means that it can not be performed in Russian, but it happened so.<br><br>

Perhaps I should write a little about my <b>experience</b>.<br><br>

I have work experience not directly connected with music:<br>
I have worked on radio station for 5 years as a sound producer and musical editor. Moreover I have composed many advertisement audio tracks. I have worked as a sound producer and composer in sound-recording studio for 1 year.<br><br>

Perhaps it will be interesting for you to know what <b>I CAN</b> and what <b>I WISH</b>?<br><br>

<b>What I can…:</b> ( professional features)<br>
Compose music in my own style, arrange my own and others music tracks.<br>

Work for a long period of time.<br>
I can professionally work with different software:<br>

<b>Something that I wish to:</b><br><br>

I want to give life to my own project.<br>
